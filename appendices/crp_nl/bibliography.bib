  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The first section analyses trends in consumption and estimates the share of inappropriate use of antimicrobials in OECD countries. This is followed by an assessment of the current and future health and economic burden caused by inappropriate use of antimicrobials and AMR. Section three spells out the main determinants underlying inappropriate antimicrobial use. Section four assesses the potential effectiveness of policy actions to promote an effective use of antimicrobials. Special emphasis is devoted to education and information activities; to organisational changes; and to a broader use of new technologies.

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Comprehensive and comparable estimates of health spending in each country are a key input for health policy and planning, and are necessary to support the achievement of national and international health goals. Previous studies have tracked past and projected future health spending until 2040 and shown that, with economic development, countries tend to spend more on health per capita, with a decreasing share of spending from development assistance and out-of-pocket sources. We aimed to characterise the past, present, and predicted future of global health spending, with an emphasis on equity in spending across countries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We estimated domestic health spending for 195 countries and territories from 1995 to 2016, split into three categories\textemdash government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending\textemdash and estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2018. We estimated future scenarios of health spending using an ensemble of linear mixed-effects models with time series specifications to project domestic health spending from 2017 through 2050 and DAH from 2019 through 2050. Data were extracted from a broad set of sources tracking health spending and revenue, and were standardised and converted to inflation-adjusted 2018 US dollars. Incomplete or low-quality data were modelled and uncertainty was estimated, leading to a complete data series of total, government, prepaid private, and out-of-pocket health spending, and DAH. Estimates are reported in 2018 US dollars, 2018 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, and as a percentage of gross domestic product. We used demographic decomposition methods to assess a set of factors associated with changes in government health spending between 1995 and 2016 and to examine evidence to support the theory of the health financing transition. We projected two alternative future scenarios based on higher government health spending to assess the potential ability of governments to generate more resources for health.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between 1995 and 2016, health spending grew at a rate of 4{$\cdot$}00\% (95\% uncertainty interval 3{$\cdot$}89\textendash 4{$\cdot$}12) annually, although it grew slower in per capita terms (2{$\cdot$}72\% [2{$\cdot$}61\textendash 2{$\cdot$}84]) and increased by less than \$1 per capita over this period in 22 of 195 countries. The highest annual growth rates in per capita health spending were observed in upper-middle-income countries (5{$\cdot$}55\% [5{$\cdot$}18\textendash 5{$\cdot$}95]), mainly due to growth in government health spending, and in lower-middle-income countries (3{$\cdot$}71\% [3{$\cdot$}10\textendash 4{$\cdot$}34]), mainly from DAH. Health spending globally reached \$8{$\cdot$}0 trillion (7{$\cdot$}8\textendash 8{$\cdot$}1) in 2016 (comprising 8{$\cdot$}6\% [8{$\cdot$}4\textendash 8{$\cdot$}7] of the global economy and \$10{$\cdot$}3 trillion [10{$\cdot$}1\textendash 10{$\cdot$}6] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), with a per capita spending of US\$5252 (5184\textendash 5319) in high-income countries, \$491 (461\textendash 524) in upper-middle-income countries, \$81 (74\textendash 89) in lower-middle-income countries, and \$40 (38\textendash 43) in low-income countries. In 2016, 0{$\cdot$}4\% (0{$\cdot$}3\textendash 0{$\cdot$}4) of health spending globally was in low-income countries, despite these countries comprising 10{$\cdot$}0\% of the global population. In 2018, the largest proportion of DAH targeted HIV/AIDS (\$9{$\cdot$}5 billion, 24{$\cdot$}3\% of total DAH), although spending on other infectious diseases (excluding tuberculosis and malaria) grew fastest from 2010 to 2018 (6{$\cdot$}27\% per year). The leading sources of DAH were the USA and private philanthropy (excluding corporate donations and the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation). For the first time, we included estimates of China's contribution to DAH (\$644{$\cdot$}7 million in 2018). Globally, health spending is projected to increase to \$15{$\cdot$}0 trillion (14{$\cdot$}0\textendash 16{$\cdot$}0) by 2050 (reaching 9{$\cdot$}4\% [7{$\cdot$}6\textendash 11{$\cdot$}3] of the global economy and \$21{$\cdot$}3 trillion [19{$\cdot$}8\textendash 23{$\cdot$}1] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), but at a lower growth rate of 1{$\cdot$}84\% (1{$\cdot$}68\textendash 2{$\cdot$}02) annually, and with continuing disparities in spending between countries. In 2050, we estimate that 0{$\cdot$}6\% (0{$\cdot$}6\textendash 0{$\cdot$}7) of health spending will occur in currently low-income countries, despite these countries comprising an estimated 15{$\cdot$}7\% of the global population by 2050. The ratio between per capita health spending in high-income and low-income countries was 130{$\cdot$}2 (122{$\cdot$}9\textendash 136{$\cdot$}9) in 2016 and is projected to remain at similar levels in 2050 (125{$\cdot$}9 [113{$\cdot$}7\textendash 138{$\cdot$}1]). The decomposition analysis identified governments' increased prioritisation of the health sector and economic development as the strongest factors associated with increases in government health spending globally. Future government health spending scenarios suggest that, with greater prioritisation of the health sector and increased government spending, health spending per capita could more than double, with greater impacts in countries that currently have the lowest levels of government health spending.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Financing for global health has increased steadily over the past two decades and is projected to continue increasing in the future, although at a slower pace of growth and with persistent disparities in per-capita health spending between countries. Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial outside of high-income countries. Many low-income countries are expected to remain dependent on development assistance, although with greater government spending, larger investments in health are feasible. In the absence of sustained new investments in health, increasing efficiency in health spending is essential to meet global health targets.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The increase of multidrug resistance and resistance to last-line antibiotics is a major global public health threat. Although surveillance programs provide useful current and historical information on the scale of the problem, the future emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is uncertain, and quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for guiding decisions about investment in antibiotics and resistance control strategies. Mathematical and statistical models capable of projecting future rates are challenged by the paucity of data and the complexity of the emergence and spread of resistance, but experts have relevant knowledge. We use the Classical Model of structured expert judgment to elicit projections with uncertainty bounds of resistance rates through 2026 for nine pathogen-antibiotic pairs in four European countries and empirically validate the assessments against data on a set of calibration questions. The performance-weighted combination of experts in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom projected that resistance for five pairs on the World Health Organization's priority pathogens list (E. coli and K. pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and MRSA) would remain below 50\% in 2026. In Italy, although upper bounds of 90\% credible ranges exceed 50\% resistance for some pairs, the medians suggest Italy will sustain or improve its current rates. We compare these expert projections to statistical forecasts based on historical data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Results from the statistical models differ from each other and from the judgmental forecasts in many cases. The judgmental forecasts include information from the experts about the impact of current and future shifts in infection control, antibiotic usage, and other factors that cannot be easily captured in statistical forecasts, demonstrating the potential of structured expert judgment as a tool for better understanding the uncertainty about future antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents ensemble models for forecasting big data time series. An ensemble composed of three methods (decision tree, gradient boosted trees and random forest) is proposed due to the good results these methods have achieved in previous big data applications. The weights of the ensemble are computed by a weighted least square method. Two strategies related to the weight update are considered, leading to a static or dynamic ensemble model. The predictions for each ensemble member are obtained by dividing the forecasting problem into h forecasting sub-problems, one for each value of the prediction horizon. These sub-problems have been solved using machine learning algorithms from the big data engine Apache Spark, ensuring the scalability of our methodology. The performance of the proposed ensemble models is evaluated on Spanish electricity consumption data for 10 years measured with a 10-minute frequency. The results showed that both the dynamic and static ensembles performed well, outperforming the individual ensemble members they combine. The dynamic ensemble was the most accurate model achieving a MRE of 2\%, which is a very promising result for the prediction of big time series. Proposed ensembles are also evaluated using solar power from Australia for two years measured with 30-min frequency. The results are successfully compared with Artificial Neural Network, Pattern Sequence-based Forecasting and Deep Learning, improving their results.},

Methods We investigated outpatient antibiotic use in 26 countries in Europe that provided internationally comparable distribution or reimbursement data, between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2002, by calculating the number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, according to WHO anatomic therapeutic chemical classification and DDD measurement methodology. We assessed the ecological association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance rates using Spearman's correlation coefficients. Findings Prescription of antibiotics in primary care in Europe varied greatly; the highest rate was in France (32{$\cdot$}2 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily) and the lowest was in the Netherlands (10{$\cdot$}0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily). We noted a shift from the old narrow-spectrum antibiotics to the new broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also recorded striking seasonal fluctuations with heightened winter peaks in countries with high yearly use of antibiotics. We showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance in high consuming countries, probably related to the higher consumption in southern and eastern Europe than in northern Europe. Interpretation These data might provide a useful method for assessing public-health strategies that aim to reduce antibiotic use and resistance levels.},

  abstract = {Background Antimicrobial resistance is widely considered an urgent global health issue due to associated mortality and disability, societal and healthcare costs. Aim To estimate the past, current and projected future proportion of infections resistant to treatment for eight priority antibiotic-bacterium combinations from 2000 to 2030 for 52 countries. Methods We collated data from a variety of sources including ResistanceMap and World Bank. Feature selection algorithms and multiple imputation were used to produce a complete historical dataset. Forecasts were derived from an ensemble of three models: exponential smoothing, linear regression and random forest. The latter two were informed by projections of antibiotic consumption, out-of-pocket medical spending, populations aged 64 years and older and under 15 years and real gross domestic product. We incorporated three types of uncertainty, producing 150 estimates for each country-antibiotic-bacterium-year. Results Average resistance proportions across antibiotic-bacterium combinations could grow moderately from 17\% to 18\% within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; growth in 64\% of uncertainty sets), from 18\% to 19\% in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA; growth in 87\% of uncertainty sets) and from 29\% to 31\% in Group of Twenty (G20) countries (growth in 62\% of uncertainty sets) between 2015 and 2030. There is broad heterogeneity in levels and rates of change across countries and antibiotic-bacterium combinations from 2000 to 2030. Conclusion If current trends continue, resistance proportions are projected to marginally increase in the coming years. The estimates indicate there is significant heterogeneity in resistance proportions across countries and antibiotic-bacterium combinations.},

Because microsimulation models are computationally more demanding than traditional Markov cohort models, the use of computer programming languages in their development has become more common. R is a programming language that has gained recognition within the field of decision modeling. It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models. We also show how this code can be extended to address more complex model structures and provide an efficient microsimulation approach that relies on vectorization solutions.},

The paper discusses the identification, measurement and valuation of productivity losses. It is recommended to include not only productivity losses related to absenteeism from and reduced productivity at paid work, but also those related to unpaid work. Hence, it is recommended to use a measurement instrument including questions about both paid and unpaid productivity, such as the iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) or the Valuation of Lost Productivity (VOLP).

The aim of the current study was to quantify differences in health-related quality-of-life of community-dwelling elderly with and without community-acquired pneumonia during a 12-month follow-up period. METHODS: In a matched cohort study design, nested in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in community-dwelling persons of {$\geq$}65~years, health-related quality-of-life was assessed in 562 subjects hospitalized with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (i.e. diseased cohort) and 1145 unaffected persons (i.e. non-diseased cohort) matched to pneumonia cases on age, sex, and health status (EQ-5D-3L-index). Health-related quality-of-life was determined 1-2~weeks after hospital discharge/inclusion and 1, 6 and 12~months thereafter, using Euroqol EQ-5D-3L and Short Form-36 Health survey questionnaires. One-year quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated for both diseased and non-diseased cohorts. Separate analyses were performed for pneumonia cases with and without radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia. RESULTS: The one-year excess QALY loss attributed to community-acquired pneumonia was 0.13. Mortality in the post-discharge follow-up year was 8.4\% in community-acquired pneumonia patients and 1.2\% in non-diseased persons (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). During follow-up health-related quality-of-life was persistently lower in community-acquired pneumonia patients, compared to non-diseased persons, but differences in health-related quality-of-life between radiologically confirmed and non-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia cases were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired pneumonia was associated with a six-fold increased mortality and 16\% lower quality-of-life in the post-discharge year among patients surviving hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, compared to non-diseased persons.

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a brief overview of tuning strategies we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {Random Forests are fast, flexible, and represent a robust approach to mining high-dimensional data. They are an extension of classification and regression trees (CART). They perform well even in the presence of a large number of features and a small number of observations. In analogy to CART, random forests can deal with continuous outcome, categorical outcome, and time-to-event outcome with censoring. The tree-building process of random forests implicitly allows for interaction between features and high correlation between features. Approaches are available to measuring variable importance and reducing the number of features. Although random forests perform well in many applications, their theoretical properties are not fully understood. Recently, several articles have provided a better understanding of random forests, and we summarize these findings. We survey different versions of random forests, including random forests for classification, random forests for probability estimation, and random forests for estimating survival data. We discuss the consequences of (1) no selection, (2) random selection, and (3) a combination of deterministic and random selection of features for random forests. Finally, we review a backward elimination and a forward procedure, the determination of trees representing a forest, and the identification of important variables in a random forest. Finally, we provide a brief overview of different areas of application of random forests.
